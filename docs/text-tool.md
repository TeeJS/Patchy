# Text tool and Character panel

The inline text editor's session machinery, commit/cancel semantics, and the Character panel. The Photoshop layout/measurement model (engine units, leading, faux bold/italic, whole-pixel folding, run-format columns) lives in [text-render-calibration.md](text-render-calibration.md); Warp Text lives in [warp.md](warp.md) and offscreen font registration in [testing.md](testing.md).

Do NOT attempt to split the remaining text code out of main_window.cpp as a pure file move: the render pipeline is shared between too many members; it is a "design a module with its own header" job, not a file split.

## One layout authority (src/ui/text_layout.hpp)

The renderer draws a text layer by walking a LINE PLAN (one `QTextLine` per visual line with the
origin it is drawn at) rather than letting QTextDocument place the lines, because Photoshop's
leading model moves baselines off Qt's natural spacing. `text_layout.hpp` owns that plan and is
the single geometric authority: `photoshop_text_layout_plan` / `boxed_text_render_plan` produce
it, and `TextLineGeometry` reads the same plan back for caret rects, selection rects and
hit-testing. Build it with the same `boxed` / `photoshop_layout` flags the render pass got and its
answers are guaranteed to agree with the drawn glyphs.

Caret and selection geometry MUST go through `TextLineGeometry`, never Qt's natural
`blockBoundingRect` origins: those drift roughly (leading - Qt line spacing) px per line on a
PS-model layer (pinned by `ui_psd_text_caret_follows_photoshop_leading`). `BoxTextLineRenderItem::block_position` exists only for this:
`QTextLine::lineNumber()` is an index within its own block's layout, so the owning block cannot be
recovered from the line alone. Caret lookup resolves the owning block FIRST, the way
`QTextDocument::findBlock` does, because a block's last line ends before the paragraph separator
and a document-wide scan answers the previous block for a position at the start of the next one.

**The caret layout must be built with the same SCALES as the render pass**, not just the same
document. `build_text_editor_document_space_layout` mirrors `update_text_editor_preview` argument
for argument: `metric_scale` AND the PSD-frame `layout_scale` (`text_editor_size_display_scale`
when `photoshop_layout && usesPsdTextFrame`). A frame session keeps its runs in raw engine units
and folds the frame's vertical scale into the glyph sizes only at render time, so a default
`layout_scale` of 1.0 lays the caret and selection out at the raw size while the glyphs draw
scaled.
`ui_psd_frame_text_highlight_matches_scaled_glyphs` pins it against the rendered ink and by
clicking mid-INK; the click probe must come from the render, since click and caret share a layout
and agree even when it is wrong.

Mouse hit-testing goes through the same plan. `QTextEdit::cursorForPosition` must never resolve a
click inside a text session: the widget hit-tests against its own internal layout (integer pixel
size `round(size * zoom)`, Qt's natural line spacing), so a click and the caret it produced can
answer different lines. `MainWindow::handle_text_editor_viewport_mouse_event`
intercepts left press/drag/double-click on the editor viewport for the flat case and
`TransformedTextEditOverlay::cursor_position_for_overlay_point` covers the transformed one; both
end at `TextLineGeometry::position_at`. Everything else (right-click menu, middle click, release)
falls through to QTextEdit. `ui_psd_text_click_returns_to_the_caret_it_drew` pins the round trip:
click exactly where the caret is drawn and the caret must come back to that position.

The editor widget is SIZED from that layout too, not from `QTextDocument::size()`. The widget's
rect is its hit area, so a widget shorter than the glyphs makes the lines past its bottom edge
unclickable: the click falls through to the canvas and the focus-loss auto-commit ends the
session.
`ui_transformed_text_click_returns_to_the_caret_it_drew` covers it on the rotated fixed-leading
fixture (transform inverse plus leading divergence).

`render_text_pixels_with_local_rect` = `build_text_render_plan` (layout, line plan, local rect,
post-fold residual transform) + `draw_text_render_plan(plan, QPainter&)`. The raster path draws
the plan into a QImage; `draw_text_layer_to_painter` (`ui/text_layer_painter.hpp`, editable PDF
export) draws the same plan through the layer's canonical text transform, so PDF text lands on
the raster. Keep the two consumers on one plan. The render also returns the plan's layout
metrics (first baseline, box baseline inset, auto-leading fraction); every caller that stores the
pixels on a layer hands them to `store_text_layout_metrics` for the PSD writer
([text-render-calibration.md](text-render-calibration.md), "re-renders where Patchy drew it").

Every type in that header holds handles into the document's `QTextLayout`. They are valid only
while that document is alive and has not been laid out again, and `build_text_render_document`
does its final `setTextWidth` before any plan is built. Keep that order.

## The text on screen is never missing

An edit session must never produce a frame with no glyphs in it:

- **The edited layer stays visible until its replacement is ready.** `add_text_at` does not hide
  it; `hide_text_editor_source_layer` does, from inside `update_text_editor_preview`, once the
  preview pixels are in place, returning the vacated region so hide and reveal land in ONE
  `document_changed_effect_bounds` call. Hiding up front blanks the text for the first-preview
  delay.
- **The debounce never removes the preview.** An expensive style re-renders on the longer delay,
  but the last good preview keeps drawing until the new one replaces it; tearing it out first
  flashes every keystroke.

`kTextEditorPreviewPaintProperty` therefore means "the glyphs come from somewhere other than this
widget", true for the whole of any previewed session; pinned by
`ui_expensive_text_style_preview_never_blanks_while_typing`.

Re-editing an existing layer must not MOVE its text. Every such session renders live through
`render_text_pixels`, plain unstyled text included (`kTextEditorForceBakedPreviewProperty`),
because the editor widget's own glyph rasterization differs from the committed layer's. `ui_text_edit_entry_leaves_the_pixels_alone` pins both flows:
enter, do nothing, and the preview must be byte-identical to the committed pixels at the same
origin, as must a re-commit.

**Every session previews, including the one that creates the text.** A new session renders over
its provisional layer, and `restore_active_layer` is that provisional (not whatever was active
before the click) so the preview insert does not steal the layer-panel selection.
For tests: on-screen glyphs are debounced, so a test that changes an option (alignment, size) and
measures pixels has to let the preview land first.

Ending a session must not flash either. `restore_text_editor_source_layer` puts the edited layer
back BEFORE `remove_text_editor_preview` takes the preview away, in commit and in cancel, so the
committed pixels carry the text through the handover.

## Session lifecycle (provisional layer, commit, cancel)

- A Type-tool click inserts a provisional 1x1 text layer (marker `patchy.internal.provisional_text`); `commit_text_editor` removes it via the marker-checked `MainWindow::take_provisional_text_layer`, then snapshots and recreates the committed layer under the same id; cancel/empty-commit leaves history and modified state untouched.
- **Commit invalidation must cover old ∪ preview ∪ new.** The restore/remove teardown pair invalidates its regions BEFORE the layer mutates, so those rects are recomposited with the pre-commit pixels; `commit_text_editor` captures the old layer and preview render bounds up front and unions them into the post-mutation `document_changed_effect_bounds`, or the old render stays baked in the canvas cache wherever the new bounds do not cover it (routine on warped layers, whose bounds change shape per edit). Same rule for `hide_text_editor_source_layer`: it returns the vacated rect and never invalidates itself, so every caller must consume the return.
- **Warped text layers get a warp-aware session**: entry resolves a Move-corrected unwarped transform and gates off every raster-derived anchor (the raster is the warped ink). See the Warp Text section of [warp.md](warp.md).
- Clicking off commits through the focus-loss handler, which arms `swallow_next_canvas_left_press_` so the press that caused the commit cannot start the next session; a release clears a stale flag. MainWindow's canvas event filter must leave that flag alone for input delivered during a blocking processing wait: on wasm the mouseup arrives re-entrantly inside the commit's undo-snapshot wait, and clearing the flag there opened a new session from one click off (input-reentry rules in [wasm.md](wasm.md); pinned by `ui_text_click_off_commit_ignores_reentrant_release_during_wait`).
- Mutating actions that take no focus (layer lock buttons) must call `finish_active_text_editor()` first, or they operate on a half-committed session.

## Delete semantics

Delete on a text layer deletes the OBJECT, never its pixels: clearing leaves an invisible layer whose metadata resurrects the text (`clear_active_layer` special-cases it; mixed selections clear pixels and delete text layers in one undo step).

## The overlay must accept click focus

`TransformedTextEditOverlay` covers the text it is editing, so it is what a click on transformed
text hits, and it must take `Qt::ClickFocus`. With `Qt::NoFocus` Qt's focus-before-press walk
(`giveFocusAccordingToFocusPolicy`) skips past it to the CanvasWidget behind, and the focus-loss
auto-commit reads that as clicking off: every click on transformed text ends the session. The overlay path is only reached from the SECOND edit of an
imported layer on: committing writes a patchy transform that moves the next session off the
PSD-frame path, where the QTextEdit takes focus itself. Focus landing on the overlay is exempt
from the auto-commit (`is_text_option_widget` objectName match); `mousePressEvent` hands focus
back to the editor.

Do NOT reach for a focus proxy here: clearing a proxy while it holds focus makes Qt reassign the
application focus widget, so the editor silently loses focus and the session commits out from
under whoever was mid-call. `configure()` runs on every cursor move, selection change and preview
refresh, so that fires constantly.

Tests that ask "would a real click reach the right widget" must use
`click_widget_like_a_user` (tests/ui/ui_test_support.cpp), which routes the press to the deepest
child under the point and applies the focus policy walk first; `send_mouse` straight to the canvas
answers a different question.

## Options bar while an editor is open

- The options bar shows session apply/cancel buttons (`textApplyButton`/`textCancelButton`) while an editor is open; they must keep `Qt::NoFocus`, or the focus-loss auto-commit fires on mouse press and Cancel commits instead of canceling.
- The font combo is a `FontPickerCombo` (src/ui/font_picker.*, a QFontComboBox whose overridden showPopup opens a searchable list + writing-system preview); its popup objectName `textFontPickerPopup` must stay matched by `is_text_option_widget` (a Qt::Popup is a window, so isAncestorOf-based ownership misses it and focusing the search box would auto-commit the session).
- **A popup pick must apply even when its row is already current.** A family the database lacks cannot be a row, so a control set to one parks on another family while `currentFont()` still names the missing one, and an index-only commit is silent there. The commit sets the index, then pushes the family through `setCurrentFont` when `currentFont().families().value(0)` still disagrees.
- Any new UI that must coexist with an open text session needs the same `is_text_option_widget` exemption from the focus-loss auto-commit.
- The inline editor claims the standard Bold and Italic shortcuts in `ShortcutOverride` before the app-level Ctrl+B Color Balance and Ctrl+I Invert actions can consume them. The key press routes to `toggle_text_bold_face` / `toggle_text_italic_face` (see the style picker section below).

## Boxed-text render clipping

Every boxed render path gates whole LINES against the frame, never raster rows: a line straddling
the frame bottom draws completely (its clip band extends below the frame by the font's descent
bleed) and lines wholly past the frame stay hidden. The editor, Photoshop-layout, and metadata
re-render paths (reopened documents, the Affinity post-open pass) share this rule in
`render_text_pixels_with_local_rect`: skipping the line plan there cuts the straddling line
mid-glyph at the buffer edge, and Affinity and Photoshop both draw it whole. The metadata path
keeps the buffer origin and width at the frame's and grows only the bottom, because pixels-only
callers place the buffer at the frame corner.

## The style picker, and what bold + italic cannot say

A family's faces are an arbitrary list; bold and italic can only name four of them. The options
bar's style picker (`textStyleCombo`) is the ONLY face control, like Photoshop: there are no B/I
buttons. `PsdTextStyleRun::style` / runs v5 column 12 persist a chosen face the flags cannot
express, and `render_text_font_for_display_family` takes it as its last argument, applying
`setStyleName` when the family really offers it and falling back to the flags otherwise (a stray
style must not render nothing).

- **A style is recorded only when the flags cannot express it.** The DirectWrite resolver and the
  picker both drop Regular/Bold/Italic/Bold Italic/Oblique variants
  (`text_style_is_flag_expressible` mirrors the reader's list), so ordinary imports and picks
  stay on runs v1-v4 and the byte-stability canaries do not move. The picker derives those four
  rows from `bold`/`italic` and previews each row in its own face (per-item `Qt::FontRole`).
- **A face name's flags union the database's answer; the database never vetoes the name**
  (`text_style_flags_for_style`): `QFontDatabase::bold` calls only weight >= 700 bold, and
  Bookman Old Style declares Bold at 600, which collapsed a "Bold Italic" pick to plain italic.
  The database still adds axes for localized face names.
- **Ctrl+B / Ctrl+I toggle the face axis during a session** (`toggle_text_bold_face` /
  `toggle_text_italic_face`): the real face when `family_offers_face_axis` says the family ships
  one, FAUX bold/italic otherwise (Ctrl+I on Century Gothic, Regular + Bold and no italic,
  applies the synthetic slant). The axis state folds the faux flag in, so a second press always
  turns the axis off, and the toggle clears any recorded exotic style (Ctrl+B on a Black run
  selects the Bold face, as Photoshop does). `family_offers_face_axis` is asked ONE AXIS AT A TIME
  on purpose, and `real_face_style_name` masks the flags the same way, so bold + italic on Century
  Gothic shows and renders the real Bold face plus a synthetic slant.
- **Never ask `QFontDatabase::styles()` with an unresolved display family.** A face-baked name
  ("ITC Lubalin Graph Demi", the "Bookman Old Style Italic" older imports recorded) lists its
  faces only under the SPLIT base family; the unsplit name answers nothing, which emptied the
  picker and diverted Ctrl+B/Ctrl+I to faux.
  `available_text_family_styles` resolves through `text_style_query_family`, probes the four
  flag combinations with `QRawFont` (forcing Qt's lazy per-family population;
  `QFontInfo::styleName` can echo the request back), re-queries for faces only the database knows
  (Light, Semibold, Black), orders the four standard faces first like Photoshop, and caches per
  family with `fontDatabaseChanged` invalidation. A family that is not installed at all still
  offers the four standard faces so the toggles do not synthesize on top of a substituted face.
- New text seeds from the picker's selection (`add_text_at`); no pre-armed bold outside a session.
- On export, `photoshop_font_name_for_run` resolves the recorded style (or the face split off a
  compound display family) to that face's PostScript name: "Arial" + "Black" writes `Arial-Black`
  instead of flattening onto `Arial-BoldMT`. Style-empty runs keep the weight-based lookup
  byte-identical, and a split whose remainder names no real face exports verbatim like any unknown
  family.
- `textStyleCombo` needs the `is_text_option_widget` exemption or focusing it auto-commits.

**Options-bar changes with NO selection apply to the whole type object**, as Photoshop does:
`merge_text_char_format` selects the whole document for a bare caret instead of falling through to
`mergeCurrentCharFormat`, which only formats the NEXT typed character.

## Font resolution

- **Characters the run's face cannot draw move to the face that draws them** on every edit
  (`substitute_uncovered_characters_in_editor`, the textChanged hook): kana typed into Arial
  commit as their own run in the Japanese family `QRawFont::fromFont(font, system)` resolves.
  Only writing systems a registered face covers are probed (the empty-family crash,
  docs/testing.md).

- **A family that resolves but covers none of the layer's characters counts as MISSING.** Patchy
  bundles Noto Naskh Arabic (third_party/fonts), whose cmap holds no Latin letters (space,
  punctuation and digits are its whole ASCII coverage), so an installed-only check rendered a
  Latin layer entirely in the fallback with no warning. `text_family_draws_any_of` probes per writing system with
  `QRawFont::fromFont(font, system)` and requires the face that comes back to BE the requested
  family: asking without the writing system resolves through the default script, so a family that
  cannot draw Latin quietly returns the Latin fallback and reports full coverage. "Any", not
  "all" -- one exotic glyph missing is ordinary per-glyph fallback, not a missing font.
  `missing_text_families_for_layer` (main_window_shared.hpp) is the shared entry point; the layer
  panel draws a warning triangle on the "T" tile and names the font in the thumbnail tooltip.
- `render_text_font_for_display_family` resolves a display name first as a family, then as
  family + style ("Arial Black" -> "Arial"/"Black"). If BOTH fail on Windows,
  `try_register_missing_system_font_family` loads every CurrentVersion\Fonts registry entry whose
  name starts with the requested family as an application font and retries: Qt's Windows database
  can miss registered fonts entirely (Arial Narrow, registered and on disk yet absent from the
  database, fell to Tahoma). `append_missing_text_family` asks the same rescue before calling a
  family missing, so the prompt and the badge never fire on a font Windows has. Attempted families
  are cached per run; application fonts are never removed (removeApplicationFont can crash live
  font users).
- On wasm, `available_text_family_match` also resolves common system families through the bundled
  metric-compatible alias table, and every text render appends a Noto Sans JP fallback family. See
  [fonts.md](fonts.md).
- **Only Regular (400) and Bold (700) survive being flattened into a family plus a bold flag.**
  The PSD reader keeps the real face for every other weight (`psd_text_read.cpp`): DirectWrite
  on Windows, the font database elsewhere (`src/ui/psd_font_resolver.hpp`), the suffix
  heuristic last (wasm stays heuristic-only so alias families never reach imported
  metadata). Flattening Demi/Semi (600) onto the family's BOLD face renders heavier
  and taller than Photoshop (ITC Lubalin Graph Demi measured 995x868 against Photoshop's 982x826
  on the entry_poster.psd body copy; the real face matches the width exactly). Gated on
  the face NAME, not the raw weight: a face whose name the flags can already express is never
  baked into the family, whatever weight it declares (Bookman Old Style ships its whole family at
  weight 500, so "BookmanOldStyle-Italic" must resolve to the plain family plus the italic flag).
  "Plain" and "Roman" (older fonts' upright regular face) are flag-expressible too; the reader's
  `face_name_is_flag_expressible` and main_window.cpp's `text_style_is_flag_expressible` must
  change together. Three further rules make the kept faces work:
  - The kept name is `family + " " + faceName`, what Qt calls such a face when it splits it into
    its own family ("ITC Lubalin Graph Demi"). The DirectWrite FULL_NAME can be a PostScript-style
    name ("LubalinGraphITCbyBT-Demi") that matches nothing in the database and falls through to a
    substitute.
  - **The stored family must be a name Qt's Windows database lists, which is the GDI name**
    (DirectWrite's WIN32_FAMILY_NAMES / WIN32_SUBFAMILY_NAMES), not the weight-stretch-style
    family and face DirectWrite derives. When the WIN32 family differs from the name built above,
    the reader stores it, keeps the WIN32 subfamily as the style only when the flags cannot
    express it, and reads bold/italic from that subfamily's words. Issue 16: Balmoral LET (one
    "Plain" face at OS/2 weight class 5) is DirectWrite family "Balmoral LET Plain" plus a
    synthesized "Medium" face, so "Balmoral LET Plain Medium" raised the missing-font prompt for
    an installed font; Franklin Gothic Medium (DirectWrite "Franklin Gothic" + "Medium", weight
    400) came back as the nonexistent family "Franklin Gothic". Simulated DirectWrite faces are
    skipped. The writer looks a GDI family DirectWrite lacks up by
    the same WIN32 strings before its prefix split, so the PostScript name round-trips.
  - The bold flag is NOT set alongside it: the name already carries the weight, and Qt would
    synthesise bold on top of the face, the same "heavier and wider" bug by another route.
    Black/Heavy (>= 800) is the deliberate exception, keeping the flag as an uninstalled-face
    fallback; its calibration is pinned by the SNES box-blurb probe.

## Character panel

- Opened via options bar > Character... while the Text tool is active; edits leading auto/fixed, tracking, H/V glyph scales, faux bold and faux italic. The leading field is never locked: a typed value turns Auto leading off (Photoshop). Number fields apply on Enter, focus loss or +/-. During inline editing it applies to the text selection, or the whole object with a bare caret. Otherwise it applies to the active unlocked text layer, including warped text, and remains usable after switching tools.
- **Faux bold is refused on warped layers** (Photoshop parity, see [warp.md](warp.md)): the checkbox shows a status error and reverts when ENABLING on a session whose layer carries an active Warp Text; unchecking stays allowed so imported faux+warp files can be fixed. Ctrl+B's faux fallback refuses the same way, while a family with a real Bold face keeps toggling normally. Faux italic is unrestricted (PS warps it fine).
- Without an inline session, the panel reads the first character's format from the stored text runs, with the transform's vertical scale and document resolution applied to displayed leading. A change creates a hidden session through `add_text_at(..., show_editor=false)` and commits it immediately through the normal Type undo/render path. It never shows an unwarped preview or takes keyboard focus; mixed run sizes and colors survive. Opening the panel alone does not mutate the layer.
- Controls disable when neither a live session nor an editable text layer is available, including pixel locks and active transform sessions. `refresh_options_bar` and `refresh_layer_controls` synchronize the panel on session, selection, lock and history changes. Tests: `ui_text_character_panel_tracks_session_and_layer`, `ui_text_character_panel_edits_selected_layer_without_session`.
- Double-clicking a text layer's T thumbnail activates the Type tool and opens the layer with all text selected, preserving zoom and pan. The deferred callback checks the document session before editing because entry may rebuild the layer rows. Pinned by `ui_text_thumbnail_double_click_selects_all_without_zoom`.
- `textCharacterDialog` is exempted from the focus-loss auto-commit via `is_text_option_widget`.
- Setting fixed leading opts the layer into the Photoshop layout marker at commit (explicit leading does not render under Qt-natural layout; see the Photoshop text model below).

## Vertical text and paragraph direction

Vertical type (`patchy.text.orientation = vertical`) and the paragraph base direction
(`patchy.text.paragraph_runs` v4 column 9: `auto`/`ltr`/`rtl`). The layout model and its
Photoshop calibration are in [text-render-calibration.md](text-render-calibration.md); this is
the session contract.

- **One Type tool, an orientation toggle.** `textOrientationButton` (and the layer context
  menu entry) switches a live session in place, converts the selected layer through the
  Character-panel hidden session (one undo step), or arms the NEXT new layer once; never
  persisted, a fresh session starts horizontal. `textDirectionCombo` is per paragraph.
- **The plan is the authority, again.** `vertical_text_layout_plan` (ui/text_layout.hpp)
  re-places every grapheme cluster of the horizontally shaped NoWrap document into a cell;
  `TextLineGeometry::from_vertical_plan` answers caret, selection and hit-testing from the plan
  `draw_vertical_text_plan` draws. `vertical_render_plan` and its `_for_editor` twin add the
  bleed and must mirror each other's scales.
- **The anchor moves the widget, not the text.** Vertical text grows LEFT (and UP when centred
  or bottom-aligned), so `relayout_text_editor` re-derives the widget origin from
  `kTextEditorVerticalAnchorProperty` (`vertical_text_layer_anchor` recovers a re-edit's from
  the raster). Imported PSD vertical layers keep the ink-anchor path, stack-axis fraction 1.
- **Arrow keys follow the columns** (`InlineTextEdit::keyPressEvent`): Up/Down step along the
  column, Left/Right jump between columns.
- **The IME is placed from the drawn caret.** `InlineTextEdit::inputMethodQuery` answers
  `ImCursorRectangle` with `text_editor_input_method_rect`: the caret's line, the whole remaining
  column for vertical text (Windows keeps the candidate list out of that rect), mapped through
  the overlay when transformed. The composition (Qt's preedit, not document text) is mirrored into
  `kTextEditorPreeditTextProperty`; `document_from_editor_in_document_units` inserts it at the
  cursor, so every render document, the caret (`text_editor_caret_position`) and an
  interrupting commit carry what is being typed.
- **Right-to-left needs no shaping work**: Qt runs bidi and HarfBuzz in QTextLayout. Alignment
  is logical (`QStyle::visualAlignment`), so the anchor helpers resolve it via
  `resolved_block_direction`. Spell non-ASCII test literals as `\x` escapes.
- Scripting: `doc.addTextLayer(text, {orientation, direction})`, `layer.textOrientation` /
  `textDirection`. Tests: `tests/ui/text_vertical_rtl_tests.cpp`.
- Known gaps: tate-chu-yoko, kinsoku, vmtx metrics,
  transformed PSD vertical imports re-anchor by the horizontal rules, box indents, uncalibrated
  vertical Warp Text, SVG export rasterizes it.

## Document geometry operations follow the text transform

Every operation that remaps document space -- Image Size, Canvas Size, Crop to Selection,
Rotate Left/Right, Rotate Arbitrary (the rotated-crop path), layer Flip Horizontal/Vertical,
and Shift Seams -- composes its matrix onto each
text layer's `patchy.text.transform` (`compose_text_layer_transform`, document_geometry.cpp)
BEFORE mutating the layer, so the implicit case can materialize translate(bounds) from
pre-operation bounds. A layer with no stored transform gets one only under a matrix with a
linear part (scale/rotate/flip); a pure translation already rides in the bounds the operation
moves. Skipping this left the transform stale, and the next metadata re-render (an edit commit,
`--append-text`, a PSD save) put the text back where and how big it was BEFORE the operation.
The `ui_*_keeps_text_transform_in_sync` and `ui_layer_flip_keeps_text_mirrored_across_reedit`
probes pin each operation with a no-change re-edit. `patchy.psd.text.*` stays untouched on
purpose: it is the import snapshot, and diverging from it is exactly what routes the PSD writer
off the templated TySh (and turns off the PSD-frame edit session via
`layer_patchy_text_transform_overrides_psd_source`).

Image Size is the one operation that RESAMPLES, so composing the matrix is not enough: the
raster is soft and the stored size, runs and box dims are still pre-resize. After the resized
document is swapped in, `resize_document_image` (so the dialog, `doc.resizeImage` and MCP all
get it) runs `rerender_text_layers_through_transforms`, which re-renders every text layer whose
transform carries scale with the free-transform commit's rules
(`rerender_text_layer_through_stored_transform`): Patchy-authored point AND box text fold the
vertical scale into the size, per-run sizes, paragraph metrics and frame dims
(`fold_text_transform_scale_into_font_size`) and re-rasterize through the residual; installed-font
PSD point text re-renders crisp through the glyph-aligned transform; everything else keeps the
resampled raster and its raster status. The options bar derives its displayed size from the
transform's vertical scale for ANY layer, so documents saved in that split state edit at the
effective size. `ui_image_size_dialog_*` and `ui_split_state_text_size_spin_shows_effective_size`
pin it.

Negative-determinant (flipped) transforms are ordinary transforms everywhere in the pipeline:
the free-transform commit composes the signed delta, the crisp re-render draws THROUGH the
mirrored matrix, and the drag preview's plain source blit applies the scale signs like the
proxy path.
`ui_point_text_flip_transform_mirrors_and_survives_reedit` pins flip -> re-edit -> flip back.

Committing empty text to an existing unlocked text layer clears its stored text
and raster with an undoable Type edit. Canceling a new empty text session still
removes only its provisional layer.
